# rdm
Rtfl package manager similar to NPM

# Installing
To install, you need [Rtfl](https://github.com/termermc/rtflc) installed as "rtfl" on your system.

For now, *Nix systems are supported, although you can compile RDM on any system that supports Rtfl.

To install, run `./install.sh` as root. This will install RDM in `/usr/local/bin`.

# Updating
Once you already have RDM installed, all you need to do in order to update is pull new changes from this repository, and then run `rdm run install` as root.
